## Title: Human Mobility in an urban context: Public transportation and Points-Of-Interest  

#### Subtitle: The study case of the city of Trento  


The starting concept is the idea of social influence, point of interests and their impact on mobility.  
Knowing that individual choices are somehow inflenced on a daily basis, the analysis starts from the concept of points of interest. By definition, *point of interest* is specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting. The next step is adding mobility into the mix. As approximation of human mobility - due to lack of available data - I decided to use bus trips and stops.
